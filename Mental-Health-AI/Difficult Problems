Sure! Here are 15 ideas for tackling highly stressful and difficult problems—some practical, some mindset-oriented, all designed to help you navigate the storm:

1. **Break it Down** – Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Focus on solving one piece at a time.

2. **Prioritize** – Identify what needs immediate attention and what can wait. Tackle the most impactful or time-sensitive issues first.

3. **Shift Perspective** – Step back and look at the situation from a different angle. Ask yourself how someone else might approach it.

4. **Breathe and Pause** – Take a few minutes to breathe deeply or meditate. Stress clouds clarity, and calm thinking leads to better choices.

5. **Write it Out** – Journaling or brain-dumping everything about the issue can help clear your mind and bring insights.

6. **Talk to Someone** – A trusted friend, mentor, or therapist can offer support, perspective, and new ideas.

7. **Sleep on It** – If it’s not urgent, rest before making a decision. Sleep helps the brain subconsciously sort through tough problems.

8. **Reframe the Narrative** – Instead of thinking “This is impossible,” try “This is tough, but I can figure it out step by step.”

9. **Accept What You Can’t Control** – Focus energy on what *can* be influenced and let go of the rest. Fighting reality increases suffering.

10. **Get Physical** – Exercise, go for a walk, or do something active to discharge stress and stimulate clearer thinking.

11. **Use Worst-Case Thinking (Strategically)** – Consider the worst-case scenario, then make a plan for it. Fear often shrinks once confronted.

12. **Set a Time Limit** – If you’re stuck, give yourself a set time to brainstorm or work on it. Boundaries reduce overwhelm.

13. **Learn from Similar Challenges** – Recall past difficulties you’ve overcome and what worked then. Use that resilience now.

14. **Change the Environment** – A change of scenery can refresh your mental state and provide new inspiration.

15. **Ask “What’s the Next Small Step?”** – You don’t need the whole solution—just the next move. Momentum builds from there.
